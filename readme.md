##WePay transaction visualization 
Transaction data parsing and d3.js / Flask web application. Current project encompasses transaction data parsing, several d3 modules for different visualization components, and three different views/pages designed for different use cases.

##Contents 
see specific files for more detailed documentation:

* **run.py**
	Running run.py from the terminal will start the web app server 

* **app/**
	Flask webapp with three different views/pages for different use-cases 
	and therefore functionality. Each view has 4 components
		1. the Flask view which handles dataFiles, and optional data
		   parsing
		2. an .html page which references Flask variables, sets up the DOM for 
		   the visualization, and references to appropriate style sheets and java scripts.
		3. a XXXpage.js script specific for the XXX page. Note: this expects other transaction modules
		   to already be loaded, and **ALL** pages require d3.js, topojson.js, and queue.js (see dependencies)
		3. .css style sheets for the specific page

	**Pages/views**:

		http://x.x.x.x:port/domain/about --> **about.html**
			- The only visualization component of this view is the map,
			  the header and footer are static content and could easily be 
			  changed
			- aboutpage.js requires a div#vis DOM element in the html page
			  to populate with the transaction map. sizing can be set in
			  aboutpage.js
			- Currently this view passes a .json datafile parameter to the 
			  front end, which then loops on the transactions in that file
			  until exit
			- map.css is included for the map styles, about-lobby.css is 
			  included for the text styling, etc.
			- mapChart.js, util.js

		http://x.x.x.x:port/domain/lobby --> **lobby.html**
			
			- This view is slightly more complex than the about view, 
			  it contains a map chart as in about.html, as well as a 
			  counter which takes a starting ct parameter and increments 
			  as transactions are animated. 
			- lobbypage.js requires a div#vis DOM element to populate with
			  the transactions map, and another element with a desired
			  id whose html contents will be replaced with transaction 
			  count values.
			- map.css is included for the map styles, about-lobby.css is 
			  included for the text styling

		http://x.x.x.x:port/domain/customer --> **customer.html** 

			- This view utilizes all transaction modules and provides the greatest funcitonality
			- It includes a transaction map, a transaction count timeline, a wepay logo, a transaction
			  counter, and sliders that control the speed and arc lifetime. Note: these variables may
			  be set to any desired value in the other views.

* **app/static/python/**
	Python module (and script) for parsing .csv files of WePay transaction 
	data. This can be used to pre-process data, or be intergrated for live 
	parsing with the app itself. Example views of both types are provided.

* **app/static/data/**
	This is the data path. All global variable paths are set to point here 
	Varying transaction data lives in data/txns/, while requried/static map 
	coordinate data for the visualization lives in data/maps

* **app/static/js/**

* **app/static/css/**

* **app/static/templates/**
	This is where the .html files for the three rendered views live.
	
	All of the DOM content in the customer.html view is generated by d3.js,
	so layout changes are controlled with customerpage.js

	while example DOM content is included in


Front-end and Back-end design

##Dependencies

###Python:
*Pandas (transaction data parsing)
*argparse (to parse data as script)
*Flask (webapp)

###Javascript (these may live in the static/lib folder, or their URIs may be referenced):

 	core visualization library
*topojson.js -- http://d3js.org/topojson.v1.min.js
	essential for map rendering within d3
*queue.js -- http://d3js.org/queue.v1.min.js
	minimal asynchronous helper module

###Other:
*Lato font is referenced as a stylesheet
